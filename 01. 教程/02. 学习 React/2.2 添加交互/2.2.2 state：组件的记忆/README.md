# State：组件的记忆

组件通常需要根据交互更改屏幕上显示的内容。输入表单应该更新输入字段，单击轮播图上的“下一个”应该更改显示的图片，单击“购买”应该将商品放入购物车。组件需要“记住”某些东西：当前输入值、当前图片、购物车。在 React 中，这种组件特有的记忆被称为 **state**。

## 当普通的变量无法满足时 

以下是一个渲染雕塑图片的组件。点击 “Next” 按钮应该显示下一个雕塑并将 `index` 更改为 `1`，再次点击又更改为 `2`，以此类推。但这个组件现在**不起作用**（你可以试一试！）：

```jsx
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
    let index = 0;
    
    function handleClick() {
        index = index + 1;
    }
    
    let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
    return (
        <>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Next
        </button>
        <h2>
            <i>{sculpture.name}</i>
            by {sculpture.artist}
        </h2>
        <h3>
            ({index + 1}) of {sculptureList.length})
        </h3>
        <img
            src={sculpture.url}
            alt={sculpture.alt}
        />
        <p>
            {sculpture.description}
        </p>
    );
}
```

`handleClick()` 事件处理函数正在更新局部变量 `index`。但存在两个原因使得变化不可见：

1. **局部变量无法在多次渲染中持久保存。** 当 React 再次渲染这个组件时，它会从头开始渲染——不会考虑之前对局部变量的任何更改。
2. **更改局部变量不会触发渲染。** React 没有意识到它需要使用新数据再次渲染组件。

要使用新数据更新组件，需要做两件事：

1. **保留** 渲染之间的数据。
2. **触发** React 使用新数据渲染组件（重新渲染）。

[`useState`](https://zh-hans.react.dev/reference/react/useState) Hook 提供了这两个功能：

1. **State 变量** 用于保存渲染间的数据。
2. **State setter 函数** 更新变量并触发 React 再次渲染组件。

## 添加一个 state 变量 

要添加 state 变量，先从文件顶部的 React 中导入 `useState`：

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

然后，替换这一行：

```jsx
let index = 0;
```

将其修改为：

```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

`index` 是一个 state 变量，`setIndex` 是对应的 setter 函数。

>这里的 `[` 和 `]` 语法称为[数组解构](https://zh.javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)，它允许你从数组中读取值。 `useState` 返回的数组总是正好有两项。

以下展示了它们在 `handleClick()` 中是如何共同起作用的：

```jsx
function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
}
```

现在点击 “Next” 按钮切换当前雕塑：

## 遇见你的第一个 Hook 

在 React 中，`useState` 以及任何其他以“`use`”开头的函数都被称为 **Hook**。

Hook 是特殊的函数，只在 React [渲染](https://zh-hans.react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render)时有效（我们将在下一节详细介绍）。它们能让你 “hook” 到不同的 React 特性中去。

State 只是这些特性中的一个，你之后还会遇到其他 Hook。

>陷阱
>
>**Hooks ——以 `use` 开头的函数——只能在组件或[自定义 Hook](https://zh-hans.react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) 的最顶层调用。** 你不能在条件语句、循环语句或其他嵌套函数内调用 Hook。Hook 是函数，但将它们视为关于组件需求的无条件声明会很有帮助。在组件顶部 “use” React 特性，类似于在文件顶部“导入”模块。

## 剖析 `useState` 

当你调用 [`useState`](https://zh-hans.react.dev/reference/react/useState) 时，你是在告诉 React 你想让这个组件记住一些东西：

```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

在这个例子里，你希望 React 记住 `index`。

>注意
>
>惯例是将这对返回值命名为 `const [thing, setThing]`。你也可以将其命名为任何你喜欢的名称，但遵照约定俗成能使跨项目合作更易理解。

`useState` 的唯一参数是 state 变量的**初始值**。在这个例子中，`index` 的初始值被`useState(0)`设置为 `0`。

每次你的组件渲染时，`useState` 都会给你一个包含两个值的数组：

1. **state 变量** (`index`) 会保存上次渲染的值。
2. **state setter 函数** (`setIndex`) 可以更新 state 变量并触发 React 重新渲染组件。

以下是实际发生的情况：

```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

1. **组件进行第一次渲染。** 因为你将 `0` 作为 `index` 的初始值传递给 `useState`，它将返回 `[0, setIndex]`。 React 记住 `0` 是最新的 state 值。
2. **你更新了 state**。当用户点击按钮时，它会调用 `setIndex(index + 1)`。 `index` 是 `0`，所以它是 `setIndex(1)`。这告诉 React 现在记住 `index` 是 `1` 并触发下一次渲染。
3. **组件进行第二次渲染**。React 仍然看到 `useState(0)`，但是因为 React *记住* 了你将 `index` 设置为了 `1`，它将返回 `[1, setIndex]`。
4. 以此类推！

## 赋予一个组件多个 state 变量 

你可以在一个组件中拥有任意多种类型的 state 变量。该组件有两个 state 变量，一个数字 `index` 和一个布尔值 `showMore`，点击 “Show Details” 会改变 `showMore` 的值：

如果它们不相关，那么存在多个 state 变量是一个好主意，例如本例中的 `index` 和 `showMore`。但是，如果你发现经常同时更改两个 state 变量，那么最好将它们合并为一个。例如，如果你有一个包含多个字段的表单，那么有一个值为对象的 state 变量比每个字段对应一个 state 变量更方便。 [选择 state 结构](https://zh-hans.react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure)在这方面有更多提示。

>深入探讨

>#### React 如何知道返回哪个 state 
>
>你可能已经注意到，`useState` 在调用时没有任何关于它引用的是*哪个* state 变量的信息。没有传递给 `useState` 的“标识符”，它是如何知道要返回哪个 state 变量呢？它是否依赖于解析函数之类的魔法？答案是否定的。
>
>相反，为了使语法更简洁，**在同一组件的每次渲染中，Hooks 都依托于一个稳定的调用顺序**。这在实践中很有效，因为如果你遵循上面的规则（“只在顶层调用 Hooks”），Hooks 将始终以相同的顺序被调用。此外，[linter 插件](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)也可以捕获大多数错误。
>
>在 React 内部，为每个组件保存了一个数组，其中每一项都是一个 state 对。它维护当前 state 对的索引值，在渲染之前将其设置为 “0”。每次调用 useState 时，React 都会为你提供一个 state 对并增加索引值。你可以在文章 [React Hooks: not magic, just arrays](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)中阅读有关此机制的更多信息。

## State 是隔离且私有的 

State 是屏幕上组件实例内部的状态。换句话说，**如果你渲染同一个组件两次，每个副本都会有完全隔离的 state**！改变其中一个不会影响另一个。

在这个例子中，之前的 `Gallery` 组件以同样的逻辑被渲染了两次。试着点击每个画廊内的按钮。你会注意到它们的 state 是相互独立的：

```javascript

```

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <section>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </section>
  );
}
```

```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

这就是 state 与声明在模块顶部的普通变量不同的原因。 State 不依赖于特定的函数调用或在代码中的位置，它的作用域“只限于”屏幕上的某块特定区域。你渲染了两个 `<Gallery />` 组件，所以它们的 state 是分别存储的。

还要注意 `Page` 组件“不知道”关于 `Gallery` state 的任何信息，甚至不知道它是否有任何 state。与 props 不同，**state 完全私有于声明它的组件**。父组件无法更改它。这使你可以向任何组件添加或删除 state，而不会影响其他组件。

如果你希望两个画廊保持其 states 同步怎么办？在 React 中执行此操作的正确方法是从子组件中*删除* state 并将其添加到离它们最近的共享父组件中。接下来的几节将专注于组织单个组件的 state，但我们将在[组件间共享 state](https://zh-hans.react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components) 中回到这个主题。

## 摘要

- 当一个组件需要在多次渲染间“记住”某些信息时使用 state 变量。
- State 变量是通过调用 `useState` Hook 来声明的。
- Hook 是以 `use` 开头的特殊函数。它们能让你 “hook” 到像 state 这样的 React 特性中。
- Hook 可能会让你想起 import：它们需要在非条件语句中调用。调用 Hook 时，包括 `useState`，仅在组件或另一个 Hook 的顶层被调用才有效。
- `useState` Hook 返回一对值：当前 state 和更新它的函数。
- 你可以拥有多个 state 变量。在内部，React 按顺序匹配它们。
- State 是组件私有的。如果你在两个地方渲染它，则每个副本都有独属于自己的 state。
